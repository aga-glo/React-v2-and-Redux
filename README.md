# React-v2 & Redux
Easy React app, function with Node.js environment 

1. Menu-function - simple show/hide menu with no other features, just random page info. (In folder there is only public and src folders, to open app you need terminal, Node.js etc.)
2. To-do-list - super primitive "to do list", you can add something, but there is no data base so after refresh there is no user data.

``` with REDUX ```
3. FavColor - easy app with Redux which shows name of color in console. No need to use terminal, also there is no view focus only on console.
4. Counter - counter with Redux, you need use (npm start), you can + or - by clicking buttons.
